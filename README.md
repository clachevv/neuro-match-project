## Neuromatch Group: "Quantrek"
Overarching Question: Can we learn how the brain processes visual stimuli in different brain regions (ROI's) by comparing FMRI data with AlexNet?

BONUS Questions: In the frames without a clear subject, is there an identifiable period of time where the participant needs to mentally search for a subject? Can we compare our DBSCAN clusters versus Quantum DBSCAN?
