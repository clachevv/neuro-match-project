Overarching Question: Can we learn how the brain processes visual stimuli in different brain regions (ROI's) by comparing FMRI data with an optimal AlexNet? 

BONUS Questions: In the frames without a clear subject, is there an identifiable period of time where the participant needs to mentally search for a subject? 
Can we use Quantum Algorithms to preprocess and cluster the data more effectively?
