## Neuromatch Group: "Quantrek"
Overarching Question: What are the encoding differences between images (maybe videos) with a clear living subject (humans, animals etc) vs. frames of the videos without that feature? BONUS: In the frames without a clear subject, is there an identifiable period of time where the participant needs to mentally search for a subject?
